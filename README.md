### Run It Yourself
1. Download this repository
2. Open it in an IDE (like VScode)
3. Run "Application.py"

By default, it will run with the following important parameters:
```
"simulation_name": "2015-2016 Admissions Cycle"
"uni_location": "New Mexico"
"num_applications": 4340
```

If you want to simulate a different year, a different home state location, the number 
of applications, or any other parameters, just open a file called "Config.json" and 
edit the values. <i>Just make sure any name that ends in "_distribution" adds up to 1</i>.

### What This Program Simulates
We keep track of the follow parameters. Internally, <strong>we apply a Â±10% variation to all 
distributions</strong> to produce "randomness".

### What Analysis Can I Do?
I compiled a few examples that you can make with this simulation under "Documentation>[Data Analysis Objectives.md](https://github.com/FerminRamos/Admissions-Office-Simulation/blob/main/Documentation/Data%20Analysis%20Objectives.md)"

Here is a snippet of that document:
```
* What proportion of applicants choose to enroll after being offered admission?
* What are the top intakes and programs and what is their impact on the total enrollment?
* How fast are we able to recruit students?
```
